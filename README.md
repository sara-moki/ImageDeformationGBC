# Image Deformation using GBC
This is a graphical user interface tool for *Image deformation using the two most well known barycentric mappings: Wachspress and Mean-value.*

---
To use this tool, a user can select whether to execute deformation on a grid or an image, where the
resolution or the grid size can be adjusted. Before pressing on Add Handle,
one can change the number of Legendre points in the parameterization, select the type
of coordinates (WC for convex regions only), and choose the handleâ€™s color. To place
the intersection-free handles, for every handle, place the vertices first by left-clicking
and then finish by right-clicking. Af
